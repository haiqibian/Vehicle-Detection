[TOC]

## 1. Overview

The project is to detect vehicle on the road using **YOLO** model. Many ideas of this project are described in the two **YOLO** papers: Redmon et al., 2016 (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640>) and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016 (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242>), and my project of *Coursera/Deep Learning/Convolutional Neural Networks/Week 3/Car Detection for Autonomous Driving* with the certificate number `WY7JJSS7Q9B9`



## 2. Project Introduction

Comparing with the class text, the **YOLO** model is relatively easier but needs higher calculate ability. This model doesn't need a lot of image preprocess, and can directly feed the model with *RGB* images, and the output is classified object and the boxes in the image. 



## 3. Project Pipeline

The pipeline is below:

1. read the test images
2. load the anchor boxes and the classification
3. define *YOLO* model and load pre-trained *h5* file 
4. predict the image
5. define the pipeline and generate the video

### 3.1 Read images

The read image function shows the original test images.

### 3.2 **YOLO**

YOLO ("you only look once") is a popular algoritm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.

![box_label](box_label.png)

#### 3.2.1 Model details

First things to know:

- The **input** is a batch of images of shape (m, 608, 608, 3)
- The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)$ as explained above. If you expand $c$ into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers.

I am using 5 anchor boxes. So the YOLO architecture is as the following: IMAGE (m, 608, 608, 3) -> DEEP CNN -> ENCODING (m, 19, 19, 5, 85).

Lets look in greater detail at what this encoding represents.

![architecture](architecture.png)

If the center/midpoint of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.

Since we are using 5 anchor boxes, each of the 19 x19 cells thus encodes information about 5 boxes. Anchor boxes are defined only by their width and height.

For simplicity, we will flatten the last two last dimensions of the shape (19, 19, 5, 85) encoding. So the output of the Deep CNN is (19, 19, 425).

![flatten](flatten.png)

Now, for each box (of each cell) we will compute the following elementwise product and extract a probability that the box contains a certain class.

![probability_extraction](probability_extraction.png)

Here's one way to visualize what YOLO is predicting on an image:

- For each of the $19\times19$ grid cells, find the maximum of the probability scores (taking a max across both the 5 anchor boxes and across different classes). 
- Color that grid cell according to what object that grid cell considers the most likely.

Doing this results in this picture:

![proba_map](proba_map.png)

Note that this visualization isn't a core part of the YOLO algorithm itself for making predictions; it's just a nice way of visualizing an intermediate result of the algorithm.

Another way to visualize YOLO's output is to plot the bounding boxes that it outputs. Doing that results in a visualization like this:

![anchor_map](anchor_map.png)

In the figure above, we plotted only boxes that the model had assigned a high probability to, but this is still too many boxes. You'd like to filter the algorithm's output down to a much smaller number of detected objects. To do so, you'll use non-max suppression. Specifically, you'll carry out these steps:

- Get rid of boxes with a low score (meaning, the box is not very confident about detecting a class)
- Select only one box when several boxes overlap with each other and detect the same object.

#### 3.2.2 Filtering with threshold on class scores

The next step is to get rid of any box for which the class "score" is less than the threshold.

The model gives you a total of 19x19x5x85 numbers, with each box described by 85 numbers. It'll be convenient to rearrange the (19,19,5,85) (or (19,19,425)) dimensional tensor into the following variables:

* `box_confidence`: tensor of shape $(19\times19, 5, 1)$ containing $p_c$ (confidence probability that there's some objects) for each of the 5 boxes predicted in each of the $19\times19$ cells.
* `boxes`: tensor of shape $(19\times19, 5, 4)$ containing $(b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$ for each of the 5 boxes per cell.
* `box_class_probs`: tensor of shape $(19\times19, 5, 80)$ containing the detection probabilities $(c_1, c_2, ..., c_{80})$ for each of 80 classes for each of the 5 boxes per cell.

```python
def yolo_filter_boxes(box_confidence, boxes, box_class_probs, threshold=.6):
    """Filters YOLO boxes by thresholding on object and class confidence.
    
    Arguments:
    box_confidence -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 1)
    boxes -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 4)
    box_class_probs -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 80)
    threshold -- real value, if [ highest class probability score < threshold], then get
    				rid of the corresponding box
    
    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None,), containing the class probability score for
    			selected boxes
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), containing (b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w) coordinates of
    			selected boxes
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), containing the index of the class detected by
    			the selected boxes
    
    Note: "None" is here because you don't know the exact number of selected boxes, as
    it depends on the threshold. 
    For example, the actual output size of scores would be (10,) if there are 10 boxes.
    """
        
    ### Code Implementation ###
    
    return scores, boxes, classes
```

#### 3.2.3 Non-max suppression

Even after filtering by thresholding over the classes scores, you still end up a lot of overlapping boxes. A second filter for selecting the right boxes is called non-maximum suppression (NMS).

![non-max-suppression](non-max-suppression.png)

Non-max suppression uses the very important function calledÂ **"Intersection over Union"**, or IoU.

![iou](iou.png)

```python
def iou(box1, box2):
    """Implement the intersection over union (IoU) between box1 and box2
    
    Arguments:
    box1 -- first box, list object with coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2)
    box2 -- second box, list object with coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2)
    """
    
    ### Code Implementation ###

    return iou
```

Now to implement non-max suppression function, the steps are:

1. Select the box that has the highest score.
2. Compute its overlap with all other boxes, and remove boxes that overlap it more than `iou_threshold`.
3. Go back to step 1 and iterate until there's no more boxes with a lower score than the current selected box.

This will remove all boxes that have a large overlap with the selected boxes. Only the "best" boxes remain.

```python
def yolo_non_max_suppression(scores, boxes, classes, max_boxes=10, iou_threshold=0.5)
    """
    Applies Non-max suppression (NMS) to set of boxes

    Arguments:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None,), output of yolo_filter_boxes()
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), output of yolo_filter_boxes() that have been
    			scaled to the image size (see later)
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), output of yolo_filter_boxes()
    max_boxes -- integer, maximum number of predicted boxes you'd like
    iou_threshold -- real value, "intersection over union" threshold used for NMS
    					filtering

    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (, None), predicted score for each box
    boxes -- tensor of shape (4, None), predicted box coordinates
    classes -- tensor of shape (, None), predicted class for each box

    Note: The "None" dimension of the output tensors has obviously to be less than
    max_boxes. Note also that this function will transpose the shapes of scores, boxes,
    classes. This is made for convenience.
    """
    
    ### Code Implementation ###
    
    return scores, boxes, classes
```

#### 3.2.4 Wrapping up the filtering

This function is to take the output of the $(19\times19\times5\times85)$ dimensional deep CNN and filter through all the boxes using the function just implemented.

The function `yolo_eval()` takes the output of the **YOLO** encoding and filters the boxes using score threshold and NMS.

There are a few ways of representing boxes, such as via their corners or via their midpoint and height/width. YOLO converts between a few such formats at different times, using the following functions (defined in the `yolo_utils.py`):

```python
boxes = yolo_boxes_to_corners(box_xy, box_wh)
```

which converts the yolo box coordinates (x,y,w,h) to box corners' coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) to fit the input of `yolo_filter_boxes`

```python
boxes = scale_boxes(boxes, image_shape)
```

YOLO's network was trained to run on 608x608 images. If you are testing this data on a different size image--for example, the car detection dataset had 720x1280 images--this step rescales the boxes so that they can be plotted on top of the original 720x1280 image. 

```python
def yolo_eval(yolo_outputs, image_shape = (720., 1280.), max_boxes=10, score_threshold=.5, iou_threshold=.5):
    """
    Converts the output of YOLO encoding (a lot of boxes) to your predicted boxes along
    with their scores, box coordinates and classes.
    
    Arguments:
    yolo_outputs -- output of the encoding model (for image_shape of (608, 608, 3)),
    contains 4 tensors:
                    box_confidence: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 1)
                    box_xy: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 2)
                    box_wh: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 2)
                    box_class_probs: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 80)
    image_shape -- tensor of shape (2,) containing the input shape, in this notebook we
    use (608., 608.) (has to be float32 dtype)
    max_boxes -- integer, maximum number of predicted boxes you'd like
    score_threshold -- real value, if [ highest class probability score < threshold],
    					then get rid of the corresponding box
    iou_threshold -- real value, "intersection over union" threshold used for NMS
    					filtering
    
    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None, ), predicted score for each box
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), predicted box coordinates
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), predicted class for each box
    """

    ### Code Implementation ###
    
    return scores, boxes, classes
```

Conclusion:

- Input image (608, 608, 3)

- The input image goes through a CNN, resulting in a (19,19,5,85) dimensional output.

- After flattening the last two dimensions, the output is a volume of shape (19, 19, 425):

  - Each cell in a 19x19 grid over the input image gives 425 numbers.
  - 425 = 5 x 85 because each cell contains predictions for 5 boxes, corresponding to 5 anchor boxes, as seen in lecture.
  - 85 = 5 + 80 where 5 is because $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$ has 5 numbers, and and 80 is the number of classes we'd like to detect

- Select only few boxes based on:

  - Score-thresholding: throw away boxes that have detected a class with a score less than the threshold
  - Non-max suppression: Compute the Intersection over Union and avoid selecting overlapping boxes




### 3.3 Test on images

```python
sess = K.get_session()
```

#### 3.3.1 Defining classes, anchors and image shape

```python
# TXT includes 80 classes information
class_names = read_classes("model_data/coco_classes.txt")
# TXT includes 5 boxes
anchors = read_anchors("model_data/yolo_anchors.txt")
# Define image shape
image_shape = (720., 1280.)
```

The `coco_classes.txt` includes 80 classes that we want YOLO to recognize, the class label either as an integer from 1 to 80, or as an 80-dimensional vector (with 80 numbers) one component of which is 1 and the rest of which are 0. 

####3.3.2 Loading pertained model

```python
yolo_model = load_model("model_data/yolo.h5")
```

This loads the weights of a trained YOLO model. Here's a summary of the layers your model contains.

```python
yolo_model.summary()
```

#### 3.3.3 Convert output of the model to usable bounding box tensors

```python
yolo_outputs = yolo_head(yolo_model.output, anchors, len(class_names))
```

#### 3.3.4 Filtering boxes

`yolo_outputs`Â provided all the predicted boxes ofÂ `yolo_model`Â in the correct format. Now is ready to perform filtering and select only the best boxes. Lets now callÂ `yolo_eval`, which you had previously implemented, to do this.

```python
scores, boxes, classes = yolo_eval(yolo_outputs, image_shape)
```

#### 3.3.5 Run on an image

Let the fun begin. A `sess` graph is created that can be summarized as follows:

1. is given to `yolo_model`. The model is used to compute the output 
2. is processed by `yolo_head`. It gives you 
3. goes through a filtering function, `yolo_eval`. It outputs your predictions.

The code below also uses the following function:

```python
image, image_data = preprocess_image("images/" + image_file, model_image_size = (608, 608))
```

which outputs:

- image: a python (PIL) representation of your image used for drawing boxes. You won't need to use it.
- image_data: a numpy-array representing the image. This will be the input to the CNN.

```python
def predict(sess, image, printlabel, scores, boxes, classes, class_names):
    """
    Runs the graph stored in "sess" to predict boxes for "image_file". Prints and plots
    the preditions.
    
    Arguments:
    sess -- your tensorflow/Keras session containing the YOLO graph
    image_file -- name of an image stored in the "images" folder.
    
    Returns:
    out_scores -- tensor of shape (None, ), scores of the predicted boxes
    out_boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), coordinates of the predicted boxes
    out_classes -- tensor of shape (None, ), class index of the predicted boxes
    
    Note: "None" actually represents the number of predicted boxes, it varies between 0
    and max_boxes. 
    """

    ### Code Implementation ###
    
    return out_scores, out_boxes, out_classes, image
```

The output image shows below:

```python
    out_scores, out_boxes, out_classes, output_image = predict(sess, image,True,scores, boxes, all_classes,class_names=classes)
    print('Found {} boxes for {}'.format(len(out_boxes), f))
    plt.imshow(output_image)
```

Conclusion:

- YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is fast and accurate  
- It runs an input image through a CNN which outputs a 19x19x5x85 dimensional volume.Â   
- The encoding can be seen as a grid where each of the 19x19 cells contains information about 5 boxes.  
- I filter through all the boxes using non-max suppression. Specifically:  

  - Score thresholding on the probability of detecting a class to keep only accurate (high probability) boxes  

  - Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholding to eliminate overlapping boxesÂ 
- Because training a YOLO model from randomly initialized weights is non-trivial and requires a large dataset as well as lot of computation, I used previously trained model parameters in this exercise.



## 4. Discussion

There is one image that the vehicle detection is failed.

```txt
Found 0 boxes for test_images/test3.jpg
```

The car is very clear for human eyes, but the **YOLO** model in this case fails to detect it.

The reason may come from the loaded pertained model. The YOLO model is very computationally expensive to train, that's why I loaded from [The official YOLO website](<https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/>). 

The way to generate `.h5` file is explained in this [github](<https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K>). What I did is as below:

1. Download `.cfg` and `.weights` of *YOLOv2 $608\times608$* from [The official YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) 

2. Open **Terminal** or **CMD** to run the following command (I defined the `.cfg` as `yolo.cfg`, same as `weights`):

   ````````````python
   python3 yad2k.py yolo.cfg yolo.weights model_data/yolo.h5
   ````````````

3. Load `.h5` into the project

There are several models in the official website, some other models with input size adaption may give a better results.
